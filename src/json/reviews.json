However, the desserts, despite their elegant presentation, failed to meet expectations in terms of taste and were overly sweet. The restaurant's atmosphere is trendy and modern, but the pricing can be on the higher side. GoodMunch is a decent choice for taco enthusiasts, but the desserts may leave you wanting more.",

    "mainReview": "GoodMunch's beef salpicao was flavorful, with tender meat and a nice garlicky kick. The honey garlic fish had a delicate sweetness, although I expected a bit more pronounced flavors. The smoked bacon was crispy and satisfying. While the overall experience was good, I wished for stronger flavors in the honey garlic fish. Nevertheless, I would still recommend trying these dishes at GoodMunch.",

The succulent beef, the deliciously seasoned garlic rice, and the perfectly cooked egg create a harmonious explosion of flavors. It's almost a flawless experience, although the occasional wait can be a minor drawback. Nonetheless, I highly recommend Tapa King for their delectable tapsilog. It's a satisfying indulgence that never fails to leave me craving for more. (4/5)",

The burgers are juicy and well-seasoned, but sometimes the service can be a bit slow, leading to longer wait times for orders. The affordability of the menu items is a definite plus, making it a budget-friendly option for pizza and burger lovers. However, the restaurant could improve in terms of overall cleanliness and ambiance. If you're looking for an affordable place with a mix of pizza and burgers, Happy N' Healthy might be worth considering, but be prepared for some service and ambiance shortcomings.",

The sushi was fresh and skillfully prepared, with a variety of flavors and textures that delighted my taste buds. The presentation of the sushi was impressive, showcasing the chef's attention to detail. The desserts were equally delightful, offering a satisfyingly sweet ending to the meal. However, the ambience of the restaurant was average, lacking a distinct atmosphere or ambiance that would elevate the dining experience. On the upside, Angrydobo's pricing was affordable, allowing diners to enjoy their sushi and desserts without breaking the bank. The service provided was satisfactory, although there were occasional delays in getting our orders. While the sushi and desserts were highlights, the average ambience and occasional service delays slightly impacted the overall experience.",
